***  README -  sha1.c  ***  

This is a public-domain implementation of SHA1, written by 
Steve Reid.  Many thanks for doing this, Steve!  

This program produces and outputs the SHA1 hash of a file 
(or STDIN if no file is specified).  

I've included the file "Vitai-Lampada.txt" to test the code with.  

As Steve has mentioned, this code is released to the public domain.  

"Share and enjoy...."    ;)
