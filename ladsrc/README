All the full programs in Linux Application Development (the ones with
line numbers in the book) have full source code listed here; only the
short fragments (without line numbers) are not available online.

We have placed this source code in the public domain.  Use it in any
project, free or commercial.  No rocket science is involved; these
programs are all simple demonstrations of system functionality.  Of
course, we would appreciate some sort of citation if you use a substantial
amount of our code in your project, at your complete discretion.

The authors and publisher have taken care in preparation of this source
code, but make no expressed or implied warranty of any kind and assume
no responsibility for errors or omissions. No liability is assumed for
incidental or consequential damages in connection with or arising out
of the use of the information or programs contained herein.

The major difference between this source code and the source code in
many other books is that we have made an attempt to catch all reasonable
errors. If you find that we have missed an error condition that you know
for a fact could occur in some situation, or that you have experienced,
please send us email at lad-comments@awl.com and give us as many details
as possible.
