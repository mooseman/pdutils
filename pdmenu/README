 ***  pdmenu  -  Tool to create menus without using curses  ***  

The pdmenu.c code is aimed at helping those who would like to    
create command-line menus without using the curses library.     	     
It creates a count variable (which could be used to    
keep track of which item is highlighted). Using the      
up and down arrow keys increments and decrements the   
count variable. Finally, when you press Enter, the      
value of the count variable is printed and the program   
exits.                                                
       
 This code is released to the public domain.
