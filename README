This project aims to produce (and find) a few public-domain *nix utilities.  
At present, there are the following - 

*  A small utility to check if a file exists in the current directory.  
*  A couple of grep utilities
*  A couple of other search utilities 
*  A calendar utility 
*  A "b-tree" utility 
*  A "day-of-week" utility 
*  A public-domain version of the getch() function 
*  A simple program (keyhandler.c) to handle function, ctrl, alt and arrow keys.  
*  A word-count program 
*  A simple tokeniser to split text into tokens 
*  A utility to check the indentation of a file. 

One of the things I'd most like to find (or do) is a public-domain versions of "awk".   

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy....."   ;)
