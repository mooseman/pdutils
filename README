 *** README  -  pdutils   ***  

This project aims to produce a few public-domain *nix utilities.  
At present, there is a utility to check the indentation of a file. 

Next will be a public-domain "readline" utility (with command history). 

After that, an attempt will be made to do public-domain versions of awk 
and grep.  Some code to help with this has already been found.  

This code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy....."   ;)
